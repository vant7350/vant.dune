# Dune Query Repo

A template for creating repos to manage your Dune queries (using the [Dune CRUD API](https://dune.com/docs/api/api-reference/edit-queries/)). The main flow I've created this template for is to turn any dashboard you own into a repository of queries. But you can extend it however you want.

### Setup Your Repo

1. Generate an API key from your Dune account and put that in both your `.env` file and [github action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) (name it 'DUNE_API_KEY'). You can create a key under your Dune team settings. *The key must be from a premium plan for this repo to work.*

2. Then, go to the dashboard you want to create a repo for (must be owned by you/your team). Click on the "github" button in the top right of your dashboard to see the query ids.

3. Copy and paste that list into the `queries.yml` file inside the `/queries` folder. You can paste any list of query ids, doesn't have to be linked to a dashboard.

4. Then, run `pull_from_dune.py` to bring in all queries into `/query_{id}.sql` files within the `/queries` folder. Directions to setup and run this script are below.

5. Make any changes you need to directly in the repo. Any time you push a commit to MAIN branch, `push_to_dune.py` will save your changes into Dune directly.

### Query Management Scripts

You'll need python installed to run the script commands. Install the required packages first:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

| Script | Action | Command |
|---|---|---|
| `pull_from_dune.py` | updates/adds queries to your repo based on ids in `queries.yml` | `python scripts/pull_from_dune.py` |
| `push_to_dune.py` | updates queries to Dune based on files in your `/queries` folder | `python scripts/push_to_dune.py` |
| `preview_query.py` | gives you the first 20 rows of results by running a query from your `/queries` folder. Specify the id. | `python scripts/preview_query.py 2615782` |

### Things to be aware of

ðŸ’¡: Names of queries are pulled into the file name the first time `pull_from_dune.py` is run. Changing the file name in app or in folder will not affect each other (they aren't synced). **Make sure you leave the `___id.sql` at the end of the file, otherwise the scripts will break!**

ðŸŸ§: Make sure to leave in the comment `-- already part of a query repo` at the top of your file. This will hopefully help prevent others from using it in more than one repo.

ðŸ”’: Queries must be owned by the team the API key was created under - otherwise you won't be able to update them from the repo.

âž•: If you want to add a query, add it in Dune app first then pull the query id (from URL `dune.com/queries/{id}/other_stuff`) into `queries.yml`

ðŸ›‘: If you accidently merge a PR or push a commit that messes up your query in Dune, you can roll back any changes using [query version history](https://dune.com/docs/app/query-editor/version-history).

### For Contributors

I've set up four types of issues right now:
- `bugs`: This is for data quality issues like miscalculations or broken queries.
- `chart_improvements`: This is for suggesting improvements to the visualizations.
- `query_improvements`: This is for suggesting improvements to the query itself, such as adding an extra column or table that enhances the results.
- `generic`: This is a catch all for other questions or suggestions you may have about the dashboard.

If you want to contribute, either start an issue or go directly into making a PR (using the same labels as above). Once the PR is merged, the queries will get updated in the frontend.
